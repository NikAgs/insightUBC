## Retrospective
This deliverable went smoother than before. I believe as it had less work and we were able to divide it equally
this deliverable was better for us. Although, we had to spend a lot of time fixing our bugs from **d1**, we were able 
to concurrently make progress on **d2** on a separate branch.
