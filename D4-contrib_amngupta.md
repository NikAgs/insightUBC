## Retrospective
As I worked independently to finish #d4 it was much easier than collaborating with someone. I was able to accomplish more than I expected and enjoyed
using the various libraries to complete this deliverable. This deliverable went were smoothly and thanks to the extended deadline, I was 
able to ensure that everything in the specifications was implemented. The commits clearly show that my partner did not contribute to any aspect of this 
deliverable as he was busy fixing the issues with our previous deliverable.
